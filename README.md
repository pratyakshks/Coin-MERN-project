# Coins

## Overview
I have a strong personal interest in Fintech and the financal sector - and have therefore stated my personal project focusing on cryptocurrencies.

The goal is to be able to create your own portfolio, showing up to date pricing information, and eventually using specific criteria to recomend trade ideas and link you to the best platform to trade on at that time.

Current API's used are Coingecko and Messari

## Technologies used
* React
* Mongo
* Express
* Node.js
* Material UI
* Bulma


## Project so far
So far the user can:

* View top 30 coins my market cap
* Click on each of these coins for more information
* More information displays % change over time, and up to date news feed
* Register and Login
* Create a Portfolio
* Add a specific coin to that portfolio from a drop down list

## Next Stages

When you add a coin and holding, it needs to show
* Value of total portfolio
* How much each coin takes up of your portfolio
* Which platform / broker currently trades that coin at the highest / lowest value
* Display all this information in a user friendly way

Add trade ideas
* What coins are being tweeted about the most / increase in tweets and news articles
* large uptick in volumes

and more!
